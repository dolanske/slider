#TODO

TODO: Compile todo from the ideas mentioned in README + the slide.js source

## Important

FIXME -

- MAKE SURE default with and height are not hardcoded but 100% so that they fill the parent element

- At the same time, a slide width should be determinded automatically by the root element's width / height instead of being set from the config.width & config.height.

- For reference check "shop" project which has these fixed already
